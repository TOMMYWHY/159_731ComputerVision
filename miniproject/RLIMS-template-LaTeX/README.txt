README for the RLIMS LaTeX class file
-------------------------------------

This package contains the following:

 * The "arlims.cls" LaTeX template for publications in RLIMS

 * The "IEEEtran.bst" BibTeX style file (a slightly modified version
   in comparison to the original that will render online references
   more friendly)

 * A simplistic template "rlims-template.tex" to simply get started
   with the class. It tries to avoid any LaTeX annoyances, and thus is
   also as noob-proof as possible.

 * The full RLIMS publication instructions "rlims-instructions.tex",
   including many bells and whistles for using the template and using
   more fully featured LaTeX tricks to "do it right".

 * The full RLIMS publication instructions "rlims-instructions.pdf"
   in PDF form for handy printing, etc.

 * The sub-directories "eps" and "pdf" containing images in the
   appropriate formats for the "latex" and "pdflatex" processor.
