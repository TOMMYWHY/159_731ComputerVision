## exercise 1

### 1.
>Save the image using a different type (choose from tif, bmp, png and other formats supported by GIMP). What is the difference in the file sizes? Is the information about each pixel still the same?

Export as bmp(76kb), png(42kb) and tif(238kb). They dont have any different by human eyes.

### 2.
> Change the colour mode from RBG to grey-scale. Save the new image as bmp.

Saved as akiyo1_grey-scale.bmp

### 3.
> Show the histogram for the image. Change the histogram (image → colours → curves).

 Saved as akiyo1_histogram.bmp
 
### 4. 
> Use GIMP to change the image. Use rotation, scaling and other geometrical transforma- tions. 

 Saved as akiyo1_rotation.bmp
